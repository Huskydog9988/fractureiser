*Pardon our dust, documentation still in progress*

## What?
`fractureiser` is a [Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) found in several Minecraft projects uploaded to CurseForge and CraftBukkit's dev website. The malware is embedded in multiple mods, some of which were added to highly popular modpacks. The Malware is only known to target Windows and Linux Systems.

If left unchecked, fractureiser can be **INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS** to your machine. Please read through this document for the info you need to keep yourself safe.

We've dubbed this malware `fractureiser` because that's the name of the CurseForge account that uploaded the most notable malicious files.

If you're simply a mod player and not a developer, the above link is all you need. It contains surface level information of the malware's effects, steps to check if you have it and how to remove it, and a FAQ.

## Current Investigation Status
We have a good idea how fractureiser works, from Stages 0 to 3. There are certain
unknowns, but the attack servers are offline and to our knowledge, *new* infections are
not possible. Old infections may still be active.

We are currently working on refining user-facing documentation, please check there for
resources.

## Additional Info

If you have files relevant to this malware, please upload them to https://wormhole.app and email the URL to fractureiser.investigation@opayq.com â€” this inbox is controlled by unascribed, and anything sent to it will be shared with the rest of the team. If you need to get in touch more generally, please send mail to jaskarth4@gmail.com.

If you copy portions of this document elsewhere, *please* put a prominent link back to this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser) somewhere near the top so that people can read the latest updates and get in contact.

We have two offical public channels of communication available to the public. The first one is is [#cfmalware on EsperNet IRC](https://webchat.esper.net/?channels=cfmalware). You may join the channel if you wish, but due to an influx of new users we've set the channel +m, meaning you will need permission to speak. 
(**Joining an IRC channel will expose your IP address.**)
The secound channel is the [fractureiser Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zPdFK47682). While this server is open to the public, your ability to message might be limited due the volume of new users.
